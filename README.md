#Hybrid Recommendation System

Built Recommendation system using lightfm

Hybrid matrix factorization algorithm for both implicit and explicit feedbacks. It works in the CPU environment.

Chose lightfm as it requires less computation(works in cpu) and is popular library for implict feedback type of data
over alternates such as Alternating Least Squares (ALS) and Tensorflow recommenders 





## Improvements

*	The total interaction dataset was less compared to user data

*	Found many outliers which but didnâ€™t delete them due to lack of domain knowledge

*	Data should contain more features other than category for better content recommendation

* More features could have been captured for collaborative filtering
